# Machine Learning Basics Final Project (Hands-On 5)

In this assignment, I performed an "end-to-end analysis on a unique dataset. You will start with an unprocessed dataset and do all the steps from previous assignments to clean, explore, visualize, and analyze your dataset." (CSE 40)

The jupyter notebook for this cumulative assignment and the randomly generated data can be found in this repository. The write-up for this assignment can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NmEy44k9BVk5D5tjxFpvKKEj8avQK1W5XBzReAoTvbA/edit?usp=sharing).

This assignment covers content from all across the class: the pandas dataframes used to hold our structured data, the calculus/probability laws we learned for understanding the underlying statistics to the data preprocessing, and the scikit-learn algorithms used to transform, model, and classify our data.
